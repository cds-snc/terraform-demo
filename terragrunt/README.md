# Instructions

You can run it by doing the following:

```
cd terragrunt/env/staging
terragrunt run-all init
terragrunt run-all plan
terragrunt run-all apply
```

Alternatively you can also choose to execute only one module (in this case it’s the same as above since there’s only one module anyway):

```
cd terragrunt/env/staging/bucket
terragrunt init
terragrunt plan
terragrunt apply
```

If you then want to simulate the production environment, it would be the same commands as above, but you start in `terragrunt/env/production` and run the same commands.
